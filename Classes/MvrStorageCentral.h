// These methods are independent of the actual kind of storage (in memory or on disk) used for this storage.

// Opportunistic reading. These methods are used to choose a "good", performance-wise and memory-wise, way to access the storage's content.

// Returns the 'best' way you can access the storage's contents. This is either a NSData or a NSInputStream object. Roughly speaking, if the object is already entirely in memory, it will exploit this by returning the NSData object; but if not, it will instead return a stream to that data on disk (or wherever it is stored).

Otherwise, if the size is unknown but the order of magnitude is, you can use ...ForStorageIn: to choose where to save the stream yourself.
// When you have finished writing to the stream and closed it, you MUST call the -endUsingOutputStream method to let the item storage take ownership of the data you wrote.
