/*
 A chunked buffer is an object whose job is to enqueue data and provide it in "chunks" no larger than a specified limit. It can be used to collect variable amounts of data and provide them again so as not to go past the limits of restrictive channels (for example, GameKit's buffers).
 
 The chunked buffer uses the one-chunk size as a sort of "high water" limit which causes messages to be sent to its delegate whenever the amount of data it manages rises past or lowers below that amount, to allow clients to know when to "ease" the load and stop fetching data to append. This is designed to be used in conjunction with the .paused property of MvrPacketBuilder.
