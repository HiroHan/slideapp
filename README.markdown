# Mover

Mover is an item sharing application for iPhone with style. You can get to know more about it at [Mover's web site](http://infinite-labs.net/mover/).

Note that the version in this repository requires iPhone OS 3.0.

In order to build it, you need to set up its dependencies. Ideally, the included scripts should do that for you. A manual procedure for doing it is also included at the end of this file, just in case.

## Checking out the code for fun? DO NOT CLONE THIS REPOSITORY!

Instead, clone the [mover-packaging](http://github.com/millenomi/mover-packaging) repository! This will set up dependencies and all for you. This works in most cases (where "most cases" basically means "you're sharing Mover's dependencies with other projects"). If you just want to try out Mover, explore it and compile it, this is the most painless way to go.

Just:

1. Clone [mover-packaging](http://github.com/millenomi/mover-packaging)
2. Run the following:
	
	sh Edge
	
and everything will be set up the way it should.

You can still clone this repository manually if you want, but you'll have to set up dependencies by hand. See below.

## Important things to know!

**IMPORTANT 1**: If you cloned this repository before June 17th, 2009, you'll need to run the following in a terminal before you can use the current release:

	cd /The/Path/Where/You/Cloned/This/Repository
	Scripts/CreateEmptyLocal
	Scripts/Ads off

**IMPORTANT 2**: Simulator builds will work fine, but you need to select "Base SDK" rather than a Device SDK to build for the device. This is due to [this Xcode bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=21402). Sigh.

Mover has already been sent to the App Store, so you don't even have to compile it on your own! [Grab a copy from App Store](http://infinite-labs.net/mover/download)


## Manual setup.

If you want to work with the repositories individually (which most of the time means "if you're me"), rather than checking them out together with packaging, you can manage the dependency settings by hand.

The automatic setup above clones a few support repos and creates "local" settings for them. You can replicate this by using the **Xcode &gt; Preferences &gt; Source Trees** command from the menu. You only have to do this once you've done this in the UI, it will also work for command-line builds. (Yes, I have like a thousand source trees in there. It's pretty sad.)

First, you have to tell the project you're going to use source trees instead of the automatic process above, by running in a terminal:

	cd /The/Path/Where/You/Cloned/This/Repository
	Scripts/CreateEmptyLocal

Then, you need to set up the source trees for the dependencies. The repos you need to clone are:

 - The âˆžlabs Build Tools. [http://github.com/millenomi/infinitelabs-build-tools](http://github.com/millenomi/infinitelabs-build-tools). Clone them in a directory, then create a source tree in Xcode named `INFINITELABS_TOOLS`, with a display name of "Infinite Labs - Tools", that points to that directory.
 - The MuiKit library. [http://github.com/millenomi/muikit](http://github.com/millenomi/muikit). Clone it in a directory, then create a source tree in Xcode named `INFINITELABS_LIB_MUIKIT`, with a display name of "Infinite Labs - MuiKit", that points to that directory.
