# Mover

Mover is an item sharing application for iPhone. For now, it's limited to sharing images and contacts, but OH I HAVE DREAMS.

In order to build it, clone the following repos:

 - The ∞labs Build Tools. [http://github.com/millenomi/infinitelabs-build-tools](http://github.com/millenomi/infinitelabs-build-tools). Clone them in a location and create a source tree in Xcode named `INFINITELABS_TOOLS` that points to that directory.
 - The ∞labs Build Tools. [http://github.com/millenomi/muikit](http://github.com/millenomi/muikit). Clone them in a location and create a source tree in Xcode named `INFINITELABS_LIB_MUIKIT` that points to that directory.

To edit your source trees, choose **Xcode &gt; Preferences &gt; Source Trees**. Yes, I have like a thousand in there. It's pretty sad.

Mover has already been sent to the App Store, so you don't even have to compile it on your own! [When it's up, this link will open Mover's App Store page in iTunes.](http://itunes.com/app/mover)
