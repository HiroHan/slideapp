	<p>If users are nearby and connected to the same network, but don't show up on the edges of your screen, your communication channel of choice may be having some trouble.</p>
	
	<h2>Check Network Status</h2>
	
	<p>Before doing anything, check your network status. Sometimes, Mover can detect trouble over a network and suggest a solution in the network status pane.</p>

		<h2>No one around over Wi-Fi?</h2>
		
		<p>Wi-Fi uses Apple's Bonjour technology to locate other devices on your network. This is the same technology that, for example, allows iTunes to share its library with other computers. Your network must support this technology, or Mover won't work over Wi-Fi. (Sorry.)</p>
		
		<p>Make sure none of the following is causing problems:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Are both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network? (You can see or change which network they are connected to by opening the <strong>Settings</strong> application, then choosing <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.)</li>
			
			<li>Are both devices on? Even if Mover is open, if you lock the screen, the device may disconnect from Wi-Fi to save battery power. Make sure both devices are turned on and unlocked.</li>
			
			<li>Is Mover Wi-Fi sharing turned on? You can check for this in <a href="x-internal:mover-network-pane" title="">your network status</a>.</li>
			
			<li>Does your Wi-Fi router or access point support Bonjour networking? Check with your manufacturer for this. You might also need to enable or allow "<strong>multicast</strong>" traffic from your router settings.</li>

		<h2>No one around over Bluetooth?</h2>
		
		<p>Mover uses iPhone OS 3.0's Peer-to-Peer Bluetooth to find other devices around you. For it to work, Bluetooth must be turned on.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure all devices you want to connect support Peer-to-Peer Bluetooth. The original iPhone (silver backside) and the original iPod touch (with black screen border) do not support Peer-to-Peer Bluetooth. (If Peer-to-Peer Bluetooth is supported, 'Bluetooth' will show up in the network status pane. <a href="x-internal:mover-network-pane" title="">See your network status</a> to check for this.)</li>
			
			<li>Is Bluetooth turned on? You can switch it on by choosing <strong>General</strong>, then <strong>Bluetooth</strong> in from your device's <strong>Settings</strong> application.</li>
			
			<li>Is Mover Bluetooth sharing turned on? You can check for this in <a href="x-internal:mover-network-pane" title="">your network status</a>.</li>
			
			<li>Are both devices on? Even if Mover is open, if you lock the screen, the device may turn off Bluetooth to save battery power. Make sure both devices are turned on and unlocked.</li>
			
			<li>Make sure the two devices are relatively near each other — Bluetooth technology may not work when the distance between devices is beyond 10 metres (around 30 feet).</li>
			
			<li>Mover only supports transfers with iPhones and iPod touch devices that have Mover installed upon them. It does not support sending items to other cell phones or computers, even if they have Bluetooth.</li>
		</ul>
