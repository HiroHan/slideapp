// Autocache support

// The autocache is a set of key-value pairs that can be removed from memory at any time.
// You can use the accessors below to set and get objects from the cache, but if you try to access the cached object for a key that does not exist, it will be automatically recreated by calling -objectForEmptyCacheKey: (which in turn calls -objectForEmpty<Key>CacheKey if it exists).
// Additionally, the cache is guaranteed never to empty itself unless there is also a storage object attached to this item. In practice, this means that you can set an object in the cache in a constructor calling -init and it won't be lost until the item has had a chance to offload itself to disk. Make sure you're able to reconstruct the object from the storage and it'll automatically be managed.

// Called when a cached object is requested for an empty key. If - (id) <key>ForCaching; exists on self, it's called and its value returned. Otherwise, it returns nil.
// Returning nil from this object does not alter the cache, and makes the cachedObjectForKey: call return nil.
